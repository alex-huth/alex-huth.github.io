I have no plans to take an intern/postdoc in 2025.

However, opportunities to work with other scientists at GFDL include the [CIMES summer research program](https://cimes.princeton.edu/education-outreach/intern-program) for undegrads and the [postdoc/visiting scholar program](https://cimes.princeton.edu/job-opportunities/postdoctoral-and-research-scientist-program).
