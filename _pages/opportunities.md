I typically host an undergraduate intern through the [CIMES summer research program](https://cimes.princeton.edu/education-outreach/intern-program) each year. Applications are due in January.

Princeton/GFDL also has a [postdoc/visiting scholar program](https://cimes.princeton.edu/job-opportunities/postdoctoral-and-research-scientist-program), with applications due each December. Please reach out if you are interested, as there may be opportunities within the glaciology group.
