I am a Physical Scientist and glaciologist at the [NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL)](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/) in Princeton, New Jersey, USA.

My research focuses on how how ice sheets and icebergs evolve over time and interact with climate. I am a developer of the GFDL iceberg module and MOM6-IS, the fully-coupled ice-sheet component for GFDL climate and Earth system models.

Prior to joining GFDL as a Physical Scientist, I was a postdoc at Princeton University in the Atmospheric & Oceanic Sciences Program, a collaboration between Princeton and GFDL. I completed my PhD in Earth and Space Sciences at the University of Washington, and I studied Science of Earth Systems as an undergrad at Cornell University.
